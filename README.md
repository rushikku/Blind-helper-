Blind people do not have luxury to read and write. Hence, I am making an 
application which will enable to read the printed text with camera by just tapping on the screen using speech engine. I have also designed a talking calculator so that blind people can use the calculator via voice commands. Along with that I have added some of the applications so that they helpful to blind people use during everyday life. It also shows your current location. With the help of this application user  will also find weather in any of the city or location. It also requires minimal effort from the user to use the application during everyday life. With the rapid growth of wireless communications, the need for voice recognition techniques have increased greatly. Voice applications based on voice interfaces, voice recognition, and voice dialogue management can help users to be focused on their current work without extra effort for hands or eyes. The application listens to your 
commands and then responds with voice commands by talking.
